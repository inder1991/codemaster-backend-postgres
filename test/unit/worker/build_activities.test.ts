/**
 * Coverage test for the Temporal worker composition root (`apps/backend/src/worker/build_activities.ts`).
 *
 * This is the regression guard for two defect classes the composition root closes:
 *
 *   1. MISSING ACTIVITIES — the pre-`buildActivities` static registry registered only a partial slice of
 *      the review-pipeline surface (no chunk/redact, embed, retrieve, workspace, or review-chunk
 *      activities). A workflow dispatching one of the absent activities crashes at runtime with
 *      `ActivityNotRegistered`. This test asserts EVERY expected activity NAME is present in the map.
 *
 *   2. THE 2-ARG LATENT CRASH — Temporal dispatches an activity with a SINGLE positional argument. A bare
 *      2-arg function (e.g. `cloneRepoIntoWorkspace(req, deps)`) registered directly receives `deps ===
 *      undefined` and crashes (or silently runs with a hole). The composition root CURRIES every such
 *      activity into a 1-arg `(input) => …` closure. A curried activity has `.length === 1`; a bare 2-arg
 *      function has `.length === 2`. This test asserts `fn.length <= 1` for EVERY registered value, so a
 *      future regression that registers a bare 2-arg function FAILS HERE rather than at dispatch time.
 *
 * ## No DB, no network
 *
 * `buildActivities()` constructs the real collaborators but the `*.fromDsn(...)` constructors build a
 * LAZY pool (no connection at construction), and the LlmClientCache + Vault wiring is deferred to first
 * `bedrockReviewChunk` invocation (the same production-deferred-Vault pattern the sibling post_* activities
 * use). So construction is cheap: it reads `CODEMASTER_PG_CORE_DSN` + `CODEMASTER_GITHUB_INSTALLATION_ID`
 * (+ `CODEMASTER_QWEN_DSN` for the embedder), which this test sets to dummy values; it never connects.
