// Phase 4b W4b.2 (review blocker #3): per-loop SUPERVISION in the background-runner composition
// (background_runner_main.ts::runSupervisedLoops). Pre-W4b.2 the composition tied the three loops
// into a fail-fast race — ANY loop's escaped error fired stopAll(), so e.g. a scheduler fault
// stopped background-job execution AND outbox draining. Proves:
//   (1) ISOLATION: one loop rigged to throw on its FIRST cycle (a pass-level fault injected via a
//       poisoned dependency) crashes ALONE — the bounded crash metric fires
//       (codemaster_runner_loop_crashed_total{loop}), the OTHER TWO loops KEEP RUNNING (the runner
//       still claims + completes a job enqueued AFTER the crash; the outbox loop keeps claiming),
//       NO loop's stop() was called as a side effect (the stopAll-on-crash anti-pattern), and the
//       supervised composition stays PENDING; then a REAL stop() (the SIGTERM analogue) drains the
//       survivors and the composition resolves with exactly the one observed crash.
//   (2) GRACEFUL: with all three loops healthy, stop() resolves the composition with ZERO crashes
//       and the crash metric never fires (a graceful stop is not misreported as a crash).
//   (3) TOTAL LOSS: when EVERY loop crashes, the composition resolves on its own (no stop() ever
//       called) naming all the crashes — the entrypoint's fail-loud exit path fires and the
//       platform restarts the pod (no zombie process lingering with zero live loops).
//
// CS3.1 (cutover-safety finding CS3 — audit C5/H7/XH11/RT2) layers the QUERYABLE liveness signal
// onto the same seam: runSupervisedLoops registers every supervised loop on the threaded
// LoopHealthRegistry BEFORE start (initially "up"), and a loop's escaped crash marks THAT loop
// down (with the crash reason) IN ADDITION to the existing metric + log — so a dead required loop
// is no longer invisible (the counter is a no-op meter in an unwired pod; /readyz is hardcoded
// ready). Each scenario asserts the registry alongside the existing supervision contract:
//   (1) ISOLATION  → the rigged loop is DOWN with its reason, the survivors stay UP,
//       allRequiredUp() false, and the crash metric STILL fires;
//   (2) GRACEFUL   → a stop()-drained run leaves every loop UP (a graceful stop is not a crash);
//   (3) TOTAL LOSS → every supervised loop (review included) is DOWN.
//
// Runs ONLY against an explicitly-set CODEMASTER_PG_CORE_DSN (the disposable :5434 DB) — never a
// shared cluster (test skips when the DSN is absent, per test/integration/_db.ts).
