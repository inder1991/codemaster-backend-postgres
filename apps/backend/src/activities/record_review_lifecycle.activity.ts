/**
 * Run-state lifecycle activities (Phase 4 Task 4 + BF-5 + BF-13).
 *
 * Composes the analysis-stage milestones into the `audit.workflow_events` stream and
 * advances `core.review_runs.lifecycle_state` to its terminal state at the boundaries of the workflow.
 * This module owns the four activities the workflow body calls at those boundaries:
 *
 *   {@link recordReviewLifecycleEvent} — emits ONE granular `audit.workflow_events` row of the given
 *     type (`ANALYSIS_STARTED` or `ANALYZED`) for the run. Idempotent under Temporal at-least-once retry:
 *     a duplicate call for the same `(run_id, event_type)` is a no-op via a pre-INSERT SELECT.
 *   {@link finalizeReviewRun} — advances `lifecycle_state` RUNNING → COMPLETED via {@link transitionRun}.
 *     AD-8 idempotency: a Temporal retry observes ALREADY_APPLIED on the second call and is a no-op.
 *   {@link recordRunFailed} — RUNNING → FAILED (BF-5). The workflow body's outermost try/except calls
 *     this with the captured exception class + truncated first message line, then re-raises.
 *   {@link recordRunCancelled} — RUNNING → CANCELLED (BF-13). The workflow body's outermost
 *     `CancelledError` clause calls this, then re-raises.
 *
 * ## Runtime context (vs. the workflow body)
 *
 * Activities run in the NORMAL Node runtime — NOT the workflow V8-isolate sandbox — so they open DB
 * sessions / transactions freely (the workflow body cannot). Production resolves the `db` from
 * `CODEMASTER_PG_CORE_DSN` (the ADR-0062 process-shared single pool per DSN); tests inject a disposable-PG
 * `db` + a {@link FakeClock}. Each activity owns its OWN one-shot transaction and (for the three
 * transition activities) its OWN {@link PendingEmits} collector — created before the transaction, drained
 * once AFTER it commits, dropped on rollback (BF-15: the AD-5 counters stay aligned with the DB state).
 *
 * ## ANALYZED vs FINDINGS_PERSISTED
 *
 * `FINDINGS_PERSISTED` is intentionally NOT emittable via {@link recordReviewLifecycleEvent} — it lives
 * inside the findings-repo INSERT transaction so the milestone shares the durable mutation's fate;
 * emitting it from a separate activity would race the durable write. The allow-list rejects it (and any
 * lifecycle-transition / stale-write event-type) at the boundary.
