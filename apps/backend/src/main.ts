// Canonical combined entrypoint — the HTTP API + ALL Temporal workers run in ONE process/pod. This is the
// production deployment shape for the TS backend (a deliberate architecture decision; it diverges from the
// Python split into separate api / worker-* deployments). Replica-safe: the outbox-dispatcher singleton is
// enforced at the Temporal workflow level (fixed workflowId + USE_EXISTING conflict policy), so every
// replica's poller is safe to run.
//
// FAIL-LOUD: the HTTP API listen happens first, then ALL resolved boot tasks run concurrently (each blocks
// for the process lifetime). If ANY of them rejects — at startup OR a runtime crash — the process exits
// non-zero so Kubernetes restarts the pod and the fault is visible to alerting. No silently-degraded pod.
// (Matches every sibling entrypoint's `.catch(() => process.exit(1))` convention.)
//
// WHICH tasks boot is the PURE resolveBootTasks seam (boot_tasks.ts — Phase 4d review blocker #6,
// reshaped by CS1.1): CODEMASTER_RUNTIME_MODE unset/"temporal" (DEFAULT) → the two Temporal workers,
// byte-identical to the pre-mode boot; "postgres"/"shadow" → ONLY the Postgres background runner (runner +
// scheduler + outbox-drain loops), with the mode threaded through so the runner knows whether it shadows.
// The two runtimes are MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE BY CONSTRUCTION — no mode boots both (the old two-boolean shape
// allowed exactly that: both runtimes fire the SAME crons and drain the SAME outbox, so the joined boot
// double-ran every cron — audit C7/C9/RC8/C8/RT1). The runner's thunk dynamic-imports its module graph, so
// the temporal-mode boot loads NOTHING of the Postgres runtime. (loop_health.ts is deliberately importable
// here: it is a leaf with zero runtime imports, NOT the runner's module graph.)
//
// PROBES (CS3.2 — cutover-safety CS3; audit C5/H7/XH11/RT2): this composition root wires the REAL
// dependency checks into /readyz — pre-CS3.2 runServer() got NO checks, so /readyz was permanently
// ready and a pod with a dead DB / sealed Vault / crashed required loop kept receiving traffic
// forever. Composition (api/dependency_checks.ts; semantics doc in api/app.ts):
//   * postgres  — a cheap SELECT 1 over THE shared ADR-0062 pool; wired when the core DSN is set
//     (omitted gracefully otherwise — a DSN-less boot has nothing to probe).
//   * vault     — the unauthenticated GET /v1/sys/health probe; wired when VAULT_ADDR is set,
//     omitted gracefully otherwise (dev/test pods without a Vault must not fail readiness on it).
//   * runtime-loops — the SHARED LoopHealthRegistry (CS3.1), created HERE and threaded BOTH into
//     runBackgroundRunner (whose runSupervisedLoops feeds it) AND into /readyz; wired ONLY in the
//     modes that boot the Postgres runtime — in temporal mode the loops are not this pod's job and
//     the check is simply absent (never fail readiness for loops that don't exist by design).
// /healthz takes NO dependency checks here — liveness is wedge-only (app.ts); a TOTAL loop loss
// needs no wedge signal because runBackgroundRunner re-throws and the fail-loud handler below
// exits the process, so the platform restarts the pod.
