/**
 * Worker bootstrap — the Temporal-TS review-pipeline SPINE worker. Brings up a single Temporal Worker that
 * registers the full review-pipeline activity surface ({@link buildActivities}) and serves the THIN spine
 * workflow (`review_pull_request.workflow`, which REPLACES the Phase-2.0 walking skeleton), wired with the
 * custom payload converter (`data_converter`).
 *
 * This is the foundational worker pattern the review pipeline reuses: NativeConnection → Worker.create
 * (with workflowsPath + activities + dataConverter) → worker.run.
 *
 * ## Isolation defaults (keep the spine OFF the real cluster's path)
 *
 * The defaults deliberately isolate this worker from production review workflows:
 *   - namespace  `dualrun`                      (env `TEMPORAL_NAMESPACE`)
 *   - taskQueue  `review-pull-request-dualrun`  (env `TEMPORAL_TASK_QUEUE`)
 *   - address    `localhost:7233`               (env `TEMPORAL_ADDRESS`)
 *   - tls        off unless `TEMPORAL_TLS=1`
 *
 * A dedicated namespace + dedicated task queue means a real worker never polls this queue and this worker
 * never polls a real queue — the spine worker cannot pick up (or be picked up by) live cluster traffic.
 * These defaults apply ONLY on a loopback address; against a real cluster (a non-loopback `TEMPORAL_ADDRESS`
 * or `NODE_ENV=production`) {@link resolveWorkerTemporalConfig} REQUIRES `TEMPORAL_NAMESPACE` +
 * `TEMPORAL_TASK_QUEUE` and fails boot otherwise (finding H) — a misconfigured prod deploy can't silently
 * poll the dualrun queue and process zero reviews.
 *
 * ## ESM ↔ CJS interop for `require.resolve`
 *
 * The package is `"type": "module"`, so there is NO ambient CommonJS `require` in this module — calling a
 * bare `require.resolve(...)` would be a `ReferenceError`. Temporal's `workflowsPath` and
 * `dataConverter.payloadConverterPath` both want a RESOLVED absolute module path (Temporal loads those
 * files itself — `workflowsPath` is webpack-bundled into the sandbox; `payloadConverterPath` is imported
 * into both threads). We therefore reconstruct `require.resolve` from the ESM entrypoint URL via
 * `createRequire(import.meta.url)` — the canonical Node ESM→CJS bridge — and resolve the two sibling
 * modules relative to THIS file. `createRequire` is bound to this module's URL, so the relative specifiers
 * resolve correctly whether the worker runs from `.ts` (tsx) or compiled `.js` (the resolver honours the
 * package `exports` / extension at runtime).

 * SIGINT-SIGTERM, which the SDK wires by default).

 * `tls` is included in the connection options ONLY when `TEMPORAL_TLS=1` — under `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`
