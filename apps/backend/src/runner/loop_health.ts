// CS3.1 (cutover-safety plan, finding CS3 — audit C5/H7/XH11/RT2): the QUERYABLE loop-liveness
// registry the supervised runtime loops feed (background_runner_main.ts::runSupervisedLoops).
//
// Pre-CS3.1 a crashed loop's ONLY trace was the codemaster_runner_loop_crashed_total counter +
// an ERROR log. The counter is emitted through the fail-safe Meter seam — a NO-OP Meter when no
// MeterProvider is wired — and /readyz is hardcoded ready, so a pod whose runner / scheduler /
// outbox / review loop had died kept reporting ready FOREVER: the degradation was invisible to
// the platform and self-healing structurally could not trigger. This registry makes "a required
// loop is dead" an in-process, queryable fact: the composition root registers every supervised
// loop BEFORE start (initially "up"), the supervisor's crash boundary marks the crashed loop
// down (in ADDITION to the existing metric + log — never instead of), and a readiness consumer
// (the CS3 follow-up wires /readyz) asks {@link LoopHealthRegistry.allRequiredUp}.
//
// Design notes:
//   * REQUIRED-ness is DECLARED by register(), never assumed — shadow mode omits the review loop
//     from the composition entirely (CS2.1), so it is simply never registered and never required.
//   * A GRACEFULLY-STOPPED loop stays "up": stop() is the process-exit path (SIGINT/SIGTERM), not
//     a degradation — readiness of a terminating pod is governed by the pod lifecycle.
//   * FAIL-LOUD wiring: duplicate register() and markDown()/markUp() on an unregistered name
//     throw — a typo'd loop name must surface as a crash at the wiring site, never silently mint
//     a health entry the readiness aggregate then keys on.
//   * Clock seam: every transition instant comes from the injected {@link Clock} (no raw
//     `new Date()` — the repo-wide clock gate), so tests pin `since` exactly with a FakeClock.
