/**
 * Runner OTel metrics (Task 1.12) — observability for the coarse-grained `review_jobs` runner.
 *
 * Mirrors the established subsystem-metric idiom (`api/auth/metrics.ts` for the histogram +
 * `observability/reconcile_metrics.ts` for the counter pattern): a module-scoped {@link Meter} and
 * instruments created once at import (avoids per-emit `create_*` lock contention), routed through the
 * `#platform/observability/metrics.js::getMeter` seam. The seam returns a no-op Meter when no
 * MeterProvider is registered, so emission is safe BEFORE the exporter is wired — no null-checks, no
 * `TODO`s in the emit path.
 *
 * Instruments (Grafana-query-stable names; renaming requires ADR):
 *   * codemaster_runner_claim_latency_ms       — histogram: wall time of a `claim()` round-trip.
 *   * codemaster_runner_lease_steals_total      — counter: a claim that RECLAIMED an expired lease
 *                                                 (reclaim mints attempts > 1) — i.e. a prior owner crashed.
 *   * codemaster_runner_heartbeat_failures_total— counter: a heartbeat refused (stale token / past timeout_at).
 *   * codemaster_runner_stale_token_writes_total{op}
 *                                                — counter: a fenced terminal write affected 0 rows (the
 *                                                  lease was stolen) — op ∈ {markDone, markFailed}.
 *   * codemaster_runner_jobs_total{outcome}     — counter: one per settled runOneJob, outcome ∈
 *                                                  {idle, done, failed, lease_lost, cancelled}.
 *   * codemaster_runner_handler_duration_ms     — histogram: wall time the handler ran (claim → settle).
 *   * codemaster_runner_retry_attempts_total    — counter: a job re-enqueued for another attempt (markFailed
 *                                                  non-terminal).
 *   * codemaster_runner_crash_loop_reaped_total — counter: rows dead-lettered by `reapCrashLooped()`.
 *
 * ## Cardinality discipline
 * Bounded-enum labels ONLY: `op` ∈ {markDone, markFailed}; `outcome` ∈ {idle, done, failed, lease_lost, cancelled}.
 * NEVER per-tenant / per-installation / per-PR / per-job labels — same discipline the sibling modules enforce.
 *
 * Fail-safe: every emit swallows meter errors so telemetry never perturbs the runner loop.
