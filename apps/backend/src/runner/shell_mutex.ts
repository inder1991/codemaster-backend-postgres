/**
 * Shell mutex acquire-or-reuse (D3 + F6) — the non-Temporal review-job shell's per-PR mutex seam.
 *
 * ## Why this exists (D3, finding #7)
 *
 * In the Temporal world the PR mutex was acquired ONCE in the `startReviewForWebhook` gate and held for the
 * whole workflow. In the runner world a job can crash and be RE-CLAIMED (same `run_id`, fresh attempt token).
 * A naive re-run that called `acquirePrReviewMutex` again would find its OWN still-live lease and get
 * `acquired=false` (`skipped_busy`) — a self-deadlock against its own corpse. {@link acquireOrReuseMutex}
 * fixes that: it persists the acquired `mutex_id` on the job row (migration 0037) on first acquire, and on a
 * re-run REUSES that same mutex instead of competing for it — but only after OWNERSHIP VALIDATION (F6).
 *
 * ## Ownership validation (F6 — "reuse needs ownership, not just live")
 *
 * The FK `review_jobs.mutex_id → pr_review_mutex(mutex_id)` (migration 0037) guarantees the referenced row
 * EXISTS; this code guarantees it is the RIGHT row before reusing it. A `mutex_id` is reused ONLY when the
 * referenced mutex row, read by {@link ReviewJobsRepo.readMutexRow}, satisfies ALL of:
 *   - `installation_id` MATCHES the job payload's installation,
 *   - `repository_id`   MATCHES the job payload's repository,
 *   - `pr_number`       MATCHES the job payload's PR,
 *   - `released_at IS NULL` (still live — a janitor sweep / prior release invalidates reuse),
 *   - reclaimable-by-us — confirmed by a successful {@link renewPrReviewMutexLease} (the per-PR partial-unique
 *     index means at most ONE live row per PR, so a live row that matches our PR IS ours to renew; the renew
 *     both proves reclaimability AND extends the lease).
 * Any mismatch / released / un-renewable row falls through to a FRESH {@link acquirePrReviewMutex} (which may
 * itself find a FOREIGN live lease → `busy`), and the fresh id is persisted over the stale one.
 *
 * ## Transaction shape (replicates the gate)
 *
 * The acquire branch runs the SAME critical section as `startReviewForWebhook`: a tenancy re-check
 * (`SELECT enabled FROM core.repositories` — default-deny) + `acquirePrReviewMutex` (advisory xact lock +
 * FOR UPDATE + INSERT) on ONE checked-out client in ONE transaction via {@link withMutexTransaction} over the
 * SHARED ADR-0062 pool. A disabled / missing repository raises (a reconcile race — the runner's terminal
 * paths surface it). The reuse branch needs only the PK read + the renew (each its own short txn).
 *
 * The `mutex_id` persist is a SEPARATE fenced UPDATE (after the acquire txn commits) so a stolen lease cannot
 * stamp a mutex id over the rightful owner (see {@link ReviewJobsRepo.persistMutexId}).

/**
 * The outcome of {@link acquireOrReuseMutex}:

 *     reuse target). `mutexId` is the new id (also persisted on the job row).
 *   - `reused`     — the job's persisted `mutex_id` passed ownership validation and was renewed; `mutexId` is it.
 *   - `busy`       — a FOREIGN live lease already holds this PR; the caller (W5.2) maps this to a terminal
 *     cancel (never spin). `mutexId` is `null`.
 *   - `lease_lost` — the fresh acquire SUCCEEDED but the FENCED `persistMutexId` did NOT (`applied:false`): the
 *     job lease was STOLEN/reclaimed between the acquire and the persist (a newer worker owns the lease now).
 *     We RELEASE the freshly-acquired mutex immediately (so it is not stranded on NO job row until the janitor
 *     sweeps it — a 30-min PR-blocking window) and report `lease_lost`. The caller (W5.2) maps this to a
 *     NON-terminal stop: this attempt yields to the worker that legitimately owns the lease (the run stays
 *     RUNNING for that worker — NOT a terminal-cancel, which `busy` would wrongly trigger). `mutexId` is `null`.
