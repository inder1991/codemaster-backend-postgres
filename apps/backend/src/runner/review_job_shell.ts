/**
 * `runReviewJob` — the non-Temporal review-job shell (Task W5.2, Step 2). The structural HEART of Phase 2:
 * it runs the EXISTING `orchestrate()` in-process (no Temporal worker/sandbox), safely re-runnable from
 * scratch on crash, with the job row (D1) as the durable workflow-argument store.
 *
 * It is a {@link JobHandler} — `runReviewJob(deps)` returns `async (job, signal) => {…}` that {@link runOneJob}
 * drives. The body REPLICATES `review_pull_request.workflow.ts::reviewPullRequest` with DIRECT calls (the
 * gate is REPLACED by the runner claim + {@link acquireOrReuseMutex}; the Temporal proxies are REPLACED by
 * {@link makeInProcessPorts} + direct lifecycle dispatches). The seven load-bearing differences from the
 * Temporal body:
 *
 *   1. PAYLOAD (D1): {@link ReviewJobsRepo.verifyPayload} re-parses + re-hashes the stored argument — a
 *      hash mismatch is a `TerminalCancelError("payload-integrity")` (never a silent drifted review).
 *   2. MUTEX (D3): {@link acquireOrReuseMutex} (acquire on first run, REUSE on re-run after ownership
 *      validation); a FOREIGN live lease → `TerminalCancelError("mutex-busy")` (never spin).
 *   3. CLAIM-CHECK (E4, fail-closed on supersede): the orchestrator's three boundaries call a hybrid check —
 *      composed-abort → throw; renew false → `mutex-lost`; `current_run_id != run_id` → `superseded`.
 *   4. COMPOSED ABORT (v3-F3): a shell-local `AbortController` is composed with the runner signal; a light
 *      mutex-renew loop aborts it on lost renewal, so EVERY port + doPost.signal stops emitting side effects
 *      after mutex loss (the claim-check boundaries are necessary but not sufficient).
 *   5. RUN-ID (#5): the ReviewPipelineContext's `pr.runId` is `job.run_id` — NEVER a freshly-minted id.
 *   6. ARBITRATION-NOW (E2): `arbitrationNow = job.started_at` ISO (stable per attempt-chain; re-runs write
 *      identical `suppressed_at`).
 *   7. TERMINAL SETTLEMENT (F4) + finally (E6): the shell does NOT transition the run — it rethrows the
 *      `TerminalCancelError` and `runOneJob`'s `terminalSettle` flips job+run in ONE transaction. The
 *      `finally` does ONLY the idempotent cleanup releases (mutex + workspace), abort-EXEMPT.
 *
 * SANDBOX-FREE: this runs in a plain Node process (the W1.1 proof pins orchestrate/degradation/posting
 * import + behave outside a workflow). Clock/Random Protocol: timing via the injected {@link Clock} +
 * {@link cancellableSleep}; NO raw timers.
