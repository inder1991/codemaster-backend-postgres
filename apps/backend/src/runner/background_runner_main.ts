// Phase 3a W4: the background-runner PROCESS ENTRYPOINT — composes the W2b BackgroundRunnerLoop
// (claim/dispatch/settle over core.background_jobs) + the W3 SchedulerLoop (the Postgres poller
// replacing Temporal Schedules) + the W2b HandlerRegistry into ONE Temporal-free runtime process.
// Closes the F6 review finding's composition gap: the three pieces existed but nothing wired them
// into a bootable process. Phase 3c adds the OutboxDispatcherLoop (the Postgres leased drain loop
// replacing the OutboxDispatcherWorkflow singleton) over the SAME shared pool/clock. CS2.1 (closes
// audit C6/OC4) composes the REVIEW-JOBS RunnerLoop (review_job_runner.ts over core.review_jobs —
// the table wireOutboxSinks routes `reviewPullRequest` onto; handler = the REAL runReviewJob; idle
// cycles run the unified reapStuckRuns) into the same process, in NON-SHADOW modes only. CS1.1: this
// runtime boots ONLY under CODEMASTER_RUNTIME_MODE=postgres|shadow (boot_tasks.ts — Temporal and
// the Postgres runtime are mutually exclusive by construction), so {@link wireOutboxSinks} ALWAYS
// binds the temporal_workflow_start / installation_reconcile sinks to the Postgres-enqueue port
// (BackgroundJobsTemporalPort) — the old CODEMASTER_OUTBOX_USE_BACKGROUND_JOBS flag (and the
// RealTemporalClient fallback it selected) is REMOVED; in temporal mode the outbox is drained by
// the separate Temporal dispatcher worker (worker/outbox_dispatcher_main.ts), never by this
// process.
//
// ## NOT STARTED IN PRODUCTION YET (deliberate)
//
// Phase 3b W3b.1 registered the FIRST handlers (registerCronHandlers: mutex_janitor +
// review_run_reaper — the 2 interval crons migrated off Temporal Schedules) and runBackgroundRunner
// seeds their core.scheduled_jobs rows at startup (ensureScheduledJobs — the ensureCronSchedule
// idempotency, as ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING). The process itself stays COLD: NO deployment manifest /
// Helm chart / Procfile boots this entrypoint yet; the Temporal schedules keep firing the same
// idempotent sweeps until the runner is deployed (and Phase 4 deletes the Temporal side). Later
// Phase 3b waves register their handlers in {@link buildBackgroundRunner} (the buildActivities
// idiom: composition-root services are closed over at registration time, not threaded through
// HandlerDeps) and append their CRON_SCHEDULES entries.
//
// ## Shape
//
//   * {@link buildBackgroundRunner} — the PURE composition seam: constructs registry + the three
//     loops over ONE shared db/clock (the ADR-0062 single-pool invariant: `tenantKysely(dsn)` in
//     prod; tests inject their own Kysely + FakeClock). Also returns single-shot drive seams
//     (`runOneCycle` / `pollOnce` / `drainOutboxOnce`) bound to the SAME pieces the loops own, so
//     tests and operator diagnostics can drive exactly one cycle/pass without the infinite loops.
//   * {@link resolveBackgroundRunnerConfig} — env parsing, fail-loud (missing DSN / garbage numbers
//     refuse to boot; a half-configured runner is worse than no runner).
//   * {@link runSupervisedLoops} — the PER-LOOP SUPERVISION seam (Phase 4b W4b.2, review blocker
//     #3): each loop's run() is awaited behind its OWN catch boundary, so one loop's escaped error
//     stops THAT loop alone (logged + codemaster_runner_loop_crashed_total{loop}) while the others
//     KEEP RUNNING. Pre-W4b.2 the composition tied the three run() promises into a fail-fast race
//     (any crash fired stopAll()) — a scheduler fault stopped background-job execution AND outbox
//     draining. CS3.1 (cutover-safety CS3): the supervisor additionally feeds a LoopHealthRegistry
//     (loop_health.ts) — every supervised loop registered REQUIRED before start, a crashed loop
//     marked down with its reason — so a dead required loop is a QUERYABLE readiness signal, not
//     only a counter on a possibly no-op Meter (CS3.2 wired it into /readyz via main.ts's shared
//     registry + the 'runtime-loops' dependency check).
//   * {@link runBackgroundRunner} — the process entrypoint: build, run ALL loops concurrently under
//     runSupervisedLoops, wire SIGINT/SIGTERM → stop() all + drain (an in-flight job/poll/drain
//     always completes; the loops' cancellableSleep wakes immediately), then dispose the shared
//     pool. stopAll() fires ONLY on the signal path — NEVER as a side effect of one loop's failure.
//     The entrypoint returns once ALL loops have ended (graceful stop or crash), re-throwing
//     fail-loud when any loop crashed, so a fully-crashed runner exits non-zero and the platform
//     restarts it instead of lingering as a zombie.
