/**
 * Repo for `core.review_walkthroughs` (review-detail P3).
 *
 * 1:1 TypeScript/Kysely port of the frozen Python source
 * `vendor/codemaster-py/codemaster/domain/repos/review_walkthroughs_repo.py`. Persists the structured
 * `WalkthroughV1` per review so the review-detail page can render the bot's TL;DR + per-file table.
 *
 * Public surface (method-for-method with the Python `ReviewWalkthroughsRepo`):
 *   - `upsert({ reviewId, installationId, walkthrough })` → `INSERT … ON CONFLICT (review_id) DO UPDATE`.
 *   - `get({ reviewId, installationId })` → tenant-scoped read; `null` when absent / in a different tenant.
 *
 * IDIOMS preserved from the frozen Python:
 *   - JSONB WRITE: the `WalkthroughV1` is serialised to a compact JSON string and bound as TEXT with an
 *     explicit `CAST(:walkthrough AS jsonb)` (Python: `walkthrough.model_dump_json()` +
 *     `CAST(:walkthrough AS jsonb)`).
 *   - JSONB READ: the column is cast `walkthrough::text` in the SELECT so we reparse it through Zod
 *     (`WalkthroughV1.parse(JSON.parse(...))`) rather than trusting the `pg` driver's auto-deserialised
 *     object — byte-faithful, and the parse re-applies the contract (Python: `walkthrough::text` +
 *     `WalkthroughV1.model_validate_json(...)`; asyncpg/`pg` return a `dict`/object otherwise).
 *   - TENANCY: every read carries the `installation_id` equality predicate (Python carries the
 *     `installation_id` token in its raw SQL to satisfy the GF-3 raw-SQL tenancy AST gate). The Kysely
 *     instance installs the {@link TenancyPlugin} (defense-in-depth; see TENANCY NOTE below).
 *   - There are NO vector columns and NO wall-clock/random in this repo: `created_at`/`updated_at`
 *     default to the server-side SQL `now()` and the conflict branch sets `updated_at = now()` in SQL,
 *     so the #platform clock/random seams are not needed (and the check_clock_random gate is a no-op
 *     here).
 *
 * TENANCY NOTE (parity-faithful): `core.review_walkthroughs` is NOT in the frozen Python tenant-scoped
 * registry (`scripts/check_tenant_scoped_raw_sql.py`) and is NOT a `TenantScoped` ORM model, so it is
 * absent from the ported {@link TENANT_SCOPED_TABLES} registry — which is why the runtime
 * `TenancyPlugin` does not hard-refuse a query that omits `installation_id` on THIS table. We still
 * (a) get a plugin-installed Kysely from {@link tenantKysely}, and (b) pass the `installation_id`
 * equality predicate on the `get` read, exactly as the Python repo does — so the moment the table is
 * added to the registry, enforcement is already in place. We deliberately do NOT mutate the
 * verbatim-ported registry here (that is a cross-cutting change outside this repo's scope).
 *
 * ADR-0062: this repo NO LONGER owns a `pg.Pool`, constructs a `new Kysely(...)`, or memoizes either.
 * It is handed a `Kysely<ReviewWalkthroughsDB>` over the process-wide single pool from
 * {@link tenantKysely} (`#platform/db/database.js`) — the structural fix that replaces the old
 * per-DSN `MEMOIZED` Pool+Kysely cache so a worker no longer fans out to `N × max` connections.
 * {@link ReviewWalkthroughsRepo.fromDsn} is the default entry point; it routes through
 * {@link tenantKysely} so every repo over the same DSN shares ONE pool. Tests / composition roots
 * that already hold a `Kysely` inject it directly via the constructor. Pool teardown is the shared
 * `disposeAllPools` / `disposePool` seam, NOT a per-repo close — a Kysely from {@link tenantKysely}
 * must NOT be `destroy()`-ed by a repo, because that would end the shared pool out from under every
 * other repo bound to the same DSN.
