/**
 * `transitionRun` lifecycle state-machine primitive (Phase 4 / Task 1 + Task 5 — R1).
 *
 * The single primitive every spine worker uses to advance a `core.review_runs.lifecycle_state` and
 * record the transition in `audit.workflow_events` as a `lifecycle_transition` row. This is the
 * operational truth for "what state is this run in right now" (AD-3 lifecycle/event split): the compact
 * canonical state lives on `review_runs`; granular processing milestones (`PR_OPENED`, `INGESTED`,
 * `ANALYZED`, `FINDINGS_PERSISTED`) live as separate `event_type` values on `workflow_events` — they are
 * *events*, not states.
 *
 * ## Five-step protocol
 *
 *   1. Validate `fromState` / `toState` ∈ {@link LIFECYCLE_STATES} + `activity` non-empty + `attempt >= 1`
 *      at the boundary — typed errors, not Postgres CHECK violations.
 *   2. Assert an OPEN transaction (the Python `session.in_transaction()` `RuntimeError` analogue): reject
 *      a handle that is not an `instanceof Transaction`. Without a txn the SELECT FOR UPDATE releases its
 *      row lock immediately and the UPDATE + event-emit chain races concurrent writers.
 *   3. SELECT current `lifecycle_state` + `review_id` + `trigger_type` + `cancel_reason` + `provider` +
 *      `installation_id` (joined through pull_request_reviews → repositories) under `FOR UPDATE OF rr`.
 *   4. Branch:
 *        * row missing → {@link StateDrift} with `actualState = null`.
 *        * (BF-3 Phase B Wave 10 R2) `installation_id` unresolved → {@link RepositoriesResolveFailed}.
 *        * (BF-9) `expectedInstallationId` mismatch → {@link CrossInstallationViolation} BEFORE any
 *          mutation; `undefined` (default) logs a structured WARN grace-period notice and proceeds.
 *        * `current === toState` → return {@link TransitionOutcome.ALREADY_APPLIED} (NO UPDATE, NO event
 *          — Temporal at-least-once retry idempotency, AD-8).
 *        * `current !== fromState` → {@link StateDrift}.
 *        * else → ONE UPDATE flipping `lifecycle_state` (+ the terminal timestamp column for
 *          COMPLETED / FAILED / CANCELLED) so the AD-7 forward + inverse CHECK constraints never observe
 *          the row mid-transition.
 *   5. Emit ONE `lifecycle_transition` event via {@link emitWorkflowEvent} with the full metadata payload
 *      (`from`, `to`, `activity`, `attempt`, `worker_id`, `duration_ms`, `reason`), in the SAME
 *      transaction.
 *
 * ## AD-5 layer-5 telemetry
 *
 * On the APPLIED branch (only — a retry that hits ALREADY_APPLIED does NOT double-count), the primitive
 * queues the failure-side counters behind {@link emitAfterCommit} so they fire ONLY on a successful
 * commit-drain (dropped on rollback — no OTel/DB drift, BF-15):
 *   - `codemaster_review_runs_failed_total{trigger_type, cancel_reason}` on FAILED (NULL cancel_reason →
 *     literal `'none'`).
 *   - `codemaster_review_runs_cancelled_total{cancel_reason}` on CANCELLED (NULL cancel_reason →
 *     literal `'unknown'`, distinct from FAILED's sentinel).
 *   - `codemaster_review_runs_draining_total` (up-down) +1 on CANCELLED (Task 8 emits the matching
 *     decrement on RUN_DRAIN_COMPLETED — not ported here).
 * Counters live under the meter scope `codemaster.review_runs` (same scope as the stale-write guard).
 *
 * The caller owns the transaction boundary AND the {@link PendingEmits} collector — it creates the
 * collector BEFORE opening the transaction, threads it here, and calls `pending.drain()` exactly once
 * AFTER the transaction commits. On rollback the caller never drains and the queued emits are dropped.
 *
 * Transaction discipline: the caller owns the txn; this function neither opens nor commits — the state
 * flip, the timestamp stamp, and the event emit share one COMMIT and are atomic from any reader.
